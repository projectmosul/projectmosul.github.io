    <p>Project Mosul is working towards the digital restoration of the heritage that has been destroyed by ISIL. Starting with the Mosul Museum using crowd-sourced imagery, we will digitally restore the artifacts, make digital surrogates of the original pieces, until such a time that they can be used to help the restoration of those origina pieces.</p>

    <p>The chat area provides a way to talk with other volunteers, brainstorm about ways we can improve on endangered heritage, and figure out new ways of protecting the history of origins, keeping it safe for generations to come.</p>
